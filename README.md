# BBQCrush
BBQCrush is a Candy Crush clone built in pure javascript and HTML.

Only Javascript and html5! No CSS, no external library, no cheat.

Use it as your refference.

## Instructions to play:

Click on a food and drag (up, down, left or right) to switch two elements in order to form at least 3 sequential objects. Score until there is no possible move.

It needs improvements on animation.

If you want to contribute, please do not use external library.
